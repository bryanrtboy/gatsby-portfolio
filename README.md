  A Gatsby Image Portfolio
</h1>

A portfolio site built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), based off of [gatsby-image-gallery](https://github.com/browniebroke/gatsby-image-gallery) by [@browniebroke](https://github.com/browniebroke).

## Project Goals

A headless server website that is fast, responsive and easy to maintain for a large database of images. The concept is to be able to have folder of images that will automatically build galleries and allow for sorting by date, media and tags. This data will be included in the filename of the images or in the EXIF data for each image.
